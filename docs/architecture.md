# Architecture

## Hub-spoke theory in multi-cluster Kubernetes

In multi-cluster Kubernetes, a **hub-spoke** model designates one administrative cluster (the **hub**) and one or more workload clusters (**spokes**). The hub owns fleet APIs: cluster inventory, policy placement, credentials for spoke registration, and often centralized GitOps controllers that fan out desired state.

Spokes remain the execution venues for application namespaces, data-plane components (Kafka, MQTT bridges, mesh dataplane), and regional isolation for latency, data residency, or blast-radius control.

## Why hub-spoke?

| Benefit | Description |
| --------|------------- |
| **Centralized management** | One control plane for membership, RBAC patterns, and bulk upgrades. |
| **Policy enforcement** | Kubernetes policies, compliance checks, and security baselines propagate from the hub. |
| **Observability** | Aggregated metrics, logging, and tracing strategies start at the hub and uniform dashboards span spokes. |
| **GitOps consistency** | A single Git revision strategy (with branch or overlay variants) drives spoke drift correction. |

## Platform architecture overview

{: .mb-4 }
*Single `main` branch: hub chart at `.`, spoke charts at `east/` and `west/`, shared `components/` referenced by all clusters.*

## Follow the request — one temperature reading end to end

When a machine sensor on the **east** spoke publishes a temperature sample, the path is: **MQTT** (`messaging` broker) → **Camel K** (`mqtt-to-kafka` integration) → **Kafka** (`dev-cluster` topic) → optional **ML scoring** (KServe) → **line-dashboard** WebSocket consumer. In parallel, **Thanos Querier** on east scrapes Istio and Kafka metrics; a **Skupper Connector** (`prometheus-east`) tunnels HTTP to the hub, where **Grafana** datasource `prometheus-east` plots the series. The **Hub Gateway** can route browser traffic to the east line-dashboard via **spoke-gateway** and Skupper listener `ie-gateway-east`. Developer Hub **Topology** shows the same pods when the catalog entity carries `backstage.io/kubernetes-cluster: east` and spoke API tokens are synced.

## GitOps application delivery flow

See **[GitOps deployment chain](gitops-deployment-chain.md)** for the full encadenamiento (hub `field-content-*` → ApplicationSet `industrial-edge-spoke` → `*-spoke-components` → spoke `*-east` / `*-west` apps) with copy-paste YAML fragments.

![GitOps sequence — hub Argo CD, ApplicationSet, remote spoke sync]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/arch-gitops-sync-sequence.png)
{: .mb-4 }
*Hub syncs first; ApplicationSet pushes per-spoke charts; each spoke Argo CD reconciles child Applications locally.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

## Sync wave ordering

Components deploy in strict order via ArgoCD sync waves:

![Argo CD sync wave ordering from bootstrap through dashboards]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/arch-sync-waves.png)
{: .mb-4 }
*Sync waves prevent operators from racing workloads — mesh and namespaces land before Industrial Edge and gateways.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

### Spoke sync-wave reference

Matches ebook Ch.4 ordering (`east/values.yaml` / `west/values.yaml`):

| Wave | What deploys | Why this order |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1 | Namespaces (no ambient label yet) | Names must exist before operators and workloads |
| 2 | OLM Subscriptions | CRDs and operators installed |
| 3 | Service Mesh 3 (Istio + ZTunnel + ambient labels wave 2 inside chart) | Mesh dataplane before application pods |
| 4 | Observability, ACS secured cluster | Scraping and security after mesh |
| 5 | Industrial Edge (Kafka, sensors, dashboard) | Pods enroll in ambient with HBONE ready |
| 6 | Spoke gateway + Skupper interconnect | Routing after backends exist |

Hub chart uses a similar pattern; ApplicationSet for spokes runs at hub wave **5** after ACM placement is healthy.

## Service Interconnect (Skupper) topology

Red Hat Service Interconnect creates a Virtual Application Network (VAN) that bridges services across clusters without VPN or direct network connectivity.

![Skupper VAN — hub Listeners, spoke Connectors, AccessGrant and AccessToken]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/arch-skupper-topology.png)
{: .mb-4 }
*Connectors expose spoke-gateway and prometheus-auth-proxy; Listeners materialize ClusterIP services on the hub.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

## Spoke gateway aggregation

Each spoke runs a **Gateway API gateway** that fronts all Industrial Edge services, providing a single entry point for Skupper to expose to the hub.

![Spoke gateway aggregates Industrial Edge HTTP routes for Skupper]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/arch-spoke-gateway.png)
{: .mb-4 }
*One Connector per spoke exposes the gateway instead of every microservice individually.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

## Multi-cluster observability pipeline

![Multi-cluster observability — spoke metrics via Skupper into hub Grafana]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/arch-observability-pipeline.png)
{: .mb-4 }
*Spoke Thanos Querier is reached through nginx auth-proxy Connectors; hub Grafana uses HTTP datasources without bearer tokens.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

## Data flow (sensors to dashboard)

## Comparison with Red Hat Validated Patterns

The **[Multicloud GitOps](https://validatedpatterns.io/patterns/multicloud-gitops)** validated pattern demonstrates fleet GitOps with OpenShift GitOps and ACM patterns that resemble this repository's hub-push model: a declarative root Application, cluster grouping, and progressive rollout.

This platform extends that idea with **Industrial Edge** workloads, **Service Mesh ambient**, **Connectivity Link**, optional **OpenShift AI**, **ACS** depth, and **Service Interconnect** for cross-cluster service exposure -- tuned for factory-style telemetry and east-west observability rather than only infrastructure provisioning.
