# Advanced Cluster Management

**Git path:** `components/acm-hub-spoke/`
{: .fs-3 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Red Hat **Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (ACM)** provides fleet-wide visibility and lifecycle for OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters. In this repository it anchors **hub-spoke registration**, **policy placement**, and integration with **OpenShift GitOps** via `GitOpsCluster` and related APIs.

*ACM Fleet Management — east and west managed clusters registered on the hub.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

## Role in this solution

- Inventory managed clusters and apply governance policies consistently.
- Drive **which spokes** receive Industrial Edge and platform components through placement rules.
- Coordinate secrets and addons required for klusterlet agents on spokes.

## Notable APIs / CRDs (overview)

Typical objects you will encounter:

- `MultiClusterHub` — hub installation status.
- `ManagedCluster`, `ManagedClusterSet` — membership grouping.
- `Placement`, `PlacementDecision` — dynamic cluster selection.
- `GitOpsCluster` — binds placement results to Argo CD managed clusters.

Install specifics live in the `acm-operator` and `acm-hub-spoke` component charts in `components/`.
