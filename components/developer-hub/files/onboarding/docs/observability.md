# Observability and consoles

## From Developer Hub

- **Overview** — OCM cluster cards (hub, east, west).
- **Kubernetes** — workloads on the spoke selected in entity annotations.
- **Topology** — mesh-aware graph when `backstage.io/kubernetes-cluster` is set.

## OpenShift console (hub)

With **cluster-reader**, use the **Platform Hub-Spoke** application menu:

| Link | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ACM Clusters | Multicluster inventory |
| Kiali Service Mesh | Hub mesh console |
| Skupper Console | Service interconnect topology |
| Grafana Dashboards | Platform metrics |
| ACS Central | Vulnerability and policy |
| Gitea | Source repos |
| Quay Registry | Container images |

## Spoke consoles

Kiali/Grafana links on spokes use the spoke apps domain (see console links deployed on each cluster).

## ACS in Developer Hub

Entities with container images may show security data when the ACS / Security Insights plugin is enabled and Central is reachable from Developer Hub.
